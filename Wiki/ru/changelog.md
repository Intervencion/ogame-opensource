# Reportbutton
Cassandra Vandales
Nov 11th 2005

As you have maybe noticed, there is suddenly a new button below the messages you get.

This button allows you now to report directly to the GOs of the universe instead of the blacklist which did not always work properly. We reacted with this to all the complains that appeared.

Any misuse of the old system is now not possible anymore. Also be aware that a misuse of the report button may lead to a warning or banning from the GOs.

Bannable offences are: insults towards other players, non english messages and if you see that a player hat an insultive planet name. Other offences have to be judged by the GOs.

We hope that this system will work way better than the old one.

The blacklist will soon be out of the system then. ATM it is still in, I will be informed when it is out.

If you find any bugs please report them.

# EspionageProbes
Amakir
Aug 4th 2006

Espionageprobes will be changed to the small thingies they were thought for

There won't be the possibility of espionage probes gathering resources. They will be able to store deuterium for their flights only. They won't be able to pick up material from e.g. a target planet.

This change will be setup on monday during the day.

# EspionageProbes the 2nd
Amakir
Aug 7th 2006

Hi all!

As we said we talked about all this again today. After we thought about many of the international suggestions we came to the following solution.
Details are worked on, but here is what we are able to tell:

1. Espionage Probes are now only able to transport their fuel which they need for the flight. (A fuel cell only uses Deuterium and so this will be logical)
2. The Espionage Probes are now no longer able to pick up ressources.
You are still able to use them to attack(to create a Debris), but they don´t pick up ressources after a successfull attack.

And now you are asking yourself what to do with those espionage probes you build up in hard work.
No details are known by now. It is worked on a way to make sure you are able to get the main part of your invested resources backconcerning the probes you built.
Not the full costs but more than you would get from a debris field produced by esp. probes.

When will this change come online?
As soon as the resources solution is finished. Till then you are able to use your espionage probes like before. The developers are working on this really hard so that everything is hopefully finished within this week.
But this will be announced early enough informing you when it will be online.

The ogame.org Team

PS.: Feel free to discuss here: EspionageProbes the 2nd discussion

Aug 10th 2006

So ^^
Here we go.
The Version is going online today.
Here are the changes:

- Cargo capacity of the espionage probes has been set again to 0
- Holding position in protected noob planets is no longer possible
- Bugfix in settings

Specialevents:

Visit the intergalactic scrap merchant until 2006-08-31.
There you are able to get back 100 % of your crystal you spend in espionageprobes.

Have Fun with the new Version.
If there are Problems, please report them.

# Bugusing
Cavalier
Sep 12th 2006

It has come to my attention that there is a bug in the game which allows activity to be hidden in the galaxy view by renaming a planet.

This post is notice to the community that in 24 hours time, each and every instance of a planet named '0' or ' 0' (without apostrophes) will be permanently banned for bugusing with no possibility of unbanning.

Anyone seen to have changed their planetnames to this name (whether to test it or any other reasons) in that time will also be permanently banned.

# Terraformer Bug fixed
Amakir
Oct 26th 2006

Hi all

We prodly present the fix of the Terraformer bug...
Some may ask: "there was a bug?" yes there was one but only for Commander users.

There was a display bug in the empire overview, showing a wrong amount of fields instead of the correct one.

For example, if your planet has 159 fields, and you get a terraformer level 3, you will have 159 + 15, 174 fields, however, in the empire overview, the calculations were done twice, so instead of 159 +15, it was 159+30.

That is going to be fixed today in all Universes

This logout function has been extended to 60 minutes.

This is a security feature for your own protection.
Disabling IP check does not mean you can trade on the same IP. It means when your session has been used on a different IP address it does not log you out of ogame.
Useful for people on some networks that use multiple IP addresses.

Please remember you should be requesting permission from your GO to disable IP check.

Thanks
