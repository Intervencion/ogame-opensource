# Changelog

Patch history to version 0.84, per the forum archives.

# Reportbutton
Cassandra Vandales
Nov 11th 2005

As you have maybe noticed, there is suddenly a new button below the messages you get.

This button allows you now to report directly to the GOs of the universe instead of the blacklist which did not always work properly. We reacted with this to all the complains that appeared.

Any misuse of the old system is now not possible anymore. Also be aware that a misuse of the report button may lead to a warning or banning from the GOs.

Bannable offences are: insults towards other players, non english messages and if you see that a player hat an insultive planet name. Other offences have to be judged by the GOs.

We hope that this system will work way better than the old one.

The blacklist will soon be out of the system then. ATM it is still in, I will be informed when it is out.

If you find any bugs please report them.

Your Ogame - Team

# EspionageProbes
Amakir
Aug 4th 2006

Espionageprobes will be changed to the small thingies they were thought for

There won't be the possibility of espionage probes gathering resources. They will be able to store deuterium for their flights only. They won't be able to pick up material from e.g. a target planet.

This change will be setup on monday during the day.

# EspionageProbes the 2nd
Amakir
Aug 7th 2006

Hi all!

As we said we talked about all this again today. After we thought about many of the international suggestions we came to the following solution.
Details are worked on, but here is what we are able to tell:

1. Espionage Probes are now only able to transport their fuel which they need for the flight. (A fuel cell only uses Deuterium and so this will be logical)
2. The Espionage Probes are now no longer able to pick up ressources.
You are still able to use them to attack(to create a Debris), but they don´t pick up ressources after a successfull attack.

And now you are asking yourself what to do with those espionage probes you build up in hard work.
No details are known by now. It is worked on a way to make sure you are able to get the main part of your invested resources backconcerning the probes you built.
Not the full costs but more than you would get from a debris field produced by esp. probes.

When will this change come online?
As soon as the resources solution is finished. Till then you are able to use your espionage probes like before. The developers are working on this really hard so that everything is hopefully finished within this week.
But this will be announced early enough informing you when it will be online.

The ogame.org Team

PS.: Feel free to discuss here: EspionageProbes the 2nd discussion

Aug 10th 2006

So ^^
Here we go.
The Version is going online today.
Here are the changes:

- Cargo capacity of the espionage probes has been set again to 0
- Holding position in protected noob planets is no longer possible
- Bugfix in settings

Specialevents:

Visit the intergalactic scrap merchant until 2006-08-31.
There you are able to get back 100 % of your crystal you spend in espionageprobes.

Have Fun with the new Version.
If there are Problems, please report them.

# Bugusing
Cavalier

This post is notice to the community that in 24 hours time, each and every instance of a planet named '0' or ' 0' (without apostrophes) will be permanently banned for bugusing with no possibility of unbanning.

Anyone seen to have changed their planetnames to this name (whether to test it or any other reasons) in that time will also be permanently banned.

# Terraformer Bug fixed
Amakir
Oct 26th 2006

Hi all

We prodly present the fix of the Terraformer bug...
Some may ask: "there was a bug?" yes there was one but only for Commander users.

There was a display bug in the empire overview, showing a wrong amount of fields instead of the correct one.

For example, if your planet has 159 fields, and you get a terraformer level 3, you will have 159 + 15, 174 fields, however, in the empire overview, the calculations were done twice, so instead of 159 +15, it was 159+30.

That is going to be fixed today in all Universes

This logout function has been extended to 60 minutes.

This is a security feature for your own protection.
Disabling IP check does not mean you can trade on the same IP. It means when your session has been used on a different IP address it does not log you out of ogame.
Useful for people on some networks that use multiple IP addresses.

Please remember you should be requesting permission from your GO to disable IP check.

Thanks

# Moon Destruction Bug
dElo
Sep 15th 2007

Currently there is a bug in which fleets on a two ways mission launched from a moon dissapear if the moon is blown with Death Stars. For that reason any person trying to eliminate someones fleet through it will get an ogame wide ban. Moreover whoever tries to get someone banned by causing it from the defenders side will get the same punishment.
Until further notice.

Edit: It will not matter whether it was done on purpose or not, punishment applies the same.

Regards,
The Game Administration.

Sep 21st 2007

A partial bugfix comes today, it will lure the fleet back to where it belongs, however it won't be showing on the phalanx yet.

The rulling above can be disregarded.

# New features: Merchant and Expeditions
The Cat
Nov 16th 2007

In the near future, there'll be a new version 0.77d, that contains a lot of bugfixes, including alliance pages and commander building que.

After that, there will be version 0.78 which will feature two completely new things:

Expeditions:

A new slot will be available in every solarsystem, the "expedition-slot".

Players can send a fleet to this new slot with the new mission-type "expedition".

When the fleet arrives, the following stuff can happen:

- you find some dark matter (can be traded for commander / officers)
- you find rescources (not more then your expedition-fleet has storage-room)
- nothing (zero..nada...zip...not even fly-poo >\_>)
- you're attacked by pirates or aliens (a CR is created)
- your fleet makes a navigation-mistake (it'll need longer/less time to come home)
- you rarely may lose your entire fleet in a black hole etc.

To be able to send out expedition-fleets you will need some low-level-researches. Which researches that will be? We don't know yet.

The max.-time the fleet can stay at the expedition-slot is the expedition-research-level in hours.
The longer the fleet stays, the higher is the chance that you find something.

Square-root of expedition-research-level = number of expeditions you can send out at the same time ( lvl 1 = 1 fleet, lvl 4 = 2 fleets etc.)

The more expeditions are sent to the same expedition-slot, the lower is the chance to find something. If the slot isn't used for a while, it "regenerates".

When you have at least 1 probe in the expedition-fleet, the expedition-report will inform you how often the slot is visited.

Merchant:

He's a rescource-trader that can be "bought" with dark-matter like the commander / officers.

When you call him, he comes to the planet you're on at this time (if you're on your homeplanet, he comes to the homeplanet, if you're on a colony, he comes to the colony).

The trade-rate he uses is 3:2:1 (met:crys:deut). Its not a fix rate, it can vary +- a bit. Everytime the merchant is called, the rate is selected randomly.

You can only trade as much as you have storage-capacity (example: You have 1 million metal, 100 crystal and no crytsal-storage; you sell metal to buy crystal, then you can only buy max. 99.900 crystal, because then the storage is full.

You may discuss the new features here: New version 0.78, merchant and expeditions

bibob_BA
Dec 19th 2007

Took some time, but now it's coming.

It's planned to be implemented tomorrow.

Content:

- performance of the universes fixed
- average-numbers in the empire-view
- new formula for the fusion-reactor-output: 30 * lvl fusion * (1,05 + lvl energytech * 0,01) ^ lvl fusion-reactor
- espionage-reports can again be shared with alliance-members
moons can be attacked with IPBMs, the planet's ABMs will defend the moon

defence-units are shown even if there is no shipyard
- you get a message when somebody rejects a buddy-request
- holding for 0 hours is possible again
commander-feature: Atom/RSS-feed for all messages in the account
- some small bugfixes
- CSS is completely forbidden on allaince-pages, for background-pictures and backgroundcolors use the following BBcodes:

1) [background image="url"]text[/background]
2) [background image="url" image-repeat='yes-x']text[/background]
3) [background image="url" image-repeat='yes-y']text[/background]
4) [background image="url" image-repeat='no']text[/background]
5) [background image="url" image-repeat='yes']text[/background]
6) [background color='farbe']text[/background]

- Phalanx-changes:

.2 new phalanx span classes
=> flight phalanx_fleet (default : green)
=> return phalanx_fleet (default : blue)
.behaviour:

flight from A --> B

a) phalanx of B => you can see the arriving fleet
b) phalanx of A => you can see the time of the backflight, but not when the fleet arrived at B ( if the fleet is still on the outward flight, you see the total flighttime of the outward flight (remaining time) + return flight )

fleet returns from B --> A

a) phalanx of B => you see nothing
b) phalanx of A => return flight visible

special case : deploy-mission A --> B

=> not phalanxable on A, only on B
=> after canceling the deploy-mission: nowhere phalanxable

.new: canceled deploy-missions aren't removed from the overview or fleetmenu anymore

- changes withnthe moondestruction:

.if a moon is destroyed fleets of the moonowner (if those fleets had the moon as startpoint) return to the planet belonging to the moon
. the fleets heading to the planet instead of the moon are phalanxable
. foreign fleets on the way to the moon are recalled automatically (!!!) (so watch out when you safe on somebody else's moon ;) )
. same as above happens when somebody delets a colony / moon / an inactive account gets deletd

# OGame Redesign - open Beta
Charmed
Dec 1st 2008

Dear Community,

After several months of development and numerous tests, in which already our international OGame teams help us energetically, we now want to give you all the possibility to try out the OGame Redesign within an open beta phase.

To realize this we want to start a temporary beta uni on Thursday, the 4th of December, in Germany and England (.org 42 & .de 6). Both will have an account reset after some time, so your nick and dark matter will stay but all the other things in the account will be reset onto 0. Beside the possibility to see and "feel" the OGame Redesign, you also have the chance with the help of an ingame ticket system to help us improving and better up the Redesign and send us directly all your bug reports and all your improvement suggestions.

Additionally both communities will get our new OGame portal already tomorrow on which you can register on thursday for our beta uni and, as usual, further on for the "old" OGame.

We look forward to a good cooperation and hope that you all can enjoy this new way of beta testing. :)

Your sincerely
GF
