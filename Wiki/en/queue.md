# Global event queue

The main module for managing the time line of the game.
The time line consists of time intervals between two events that affect the state of player accounts.
The events of all players are queued in a common queue. The queue is discrete - each event is synchronized on a second-by-second basis.
Checking for event completion (queue movement) is performed when players perform any actions (navigate through pages).
If two events fall on the same second, they are processed in order of priority (e.g. if Attack coincides in time with Recycle,
on the same coordinates, the Attack is processed first, and then Recycle).

Each event has a beginning (start time) and an end (end time of the event). Some events can be canceled. Canceling some events generates 
other events (e.g. canceling a fleet task generates a new fleet return task).

Main types of account events:
 - Time counters on a player's account (officers exiration, account deletion, etc).
 - Construction on a planet/moon
 - Research
 - Shipyard construction
 - Tasks for fleet and IPM
 - Global events for all players (re-login, cleaning of virtual debris fields, deletion of destroyed planets, recalculation of points 3 times a day, etc.).

Recording of old scores: 8:05, 16:05, 20:05 on the server

Static recalculation of player points: 0:10 on the server

Virtual DF disappears on Monday at 1:10 server time if no fleets fly to/from it and if it has 0 resources.

How the queue is updated:
After another click by one of the users, each queue job is checked for completion. If the task is completed, its handler is called and the task is removed from the queue.

## CRON

If you want, you can assign a cron.php script to run periodically, so that the queue moves on its own, without player action.
But in a crowded universe, you don't need to do that at all.
