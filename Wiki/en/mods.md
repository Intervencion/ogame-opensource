# Mods

This section contains information on modifications.

Although the main game engine is based on the ideal version 0.84, nobody forbids to launch universes with peculiarities for the sake of fan.

So far here is just a collection of ideas.

- Number of battle rounds. By default no more than 6
- Duration of the battle. Right now, battles are instantaneous and cannot be "interfered" with. You can add a mutation that stretches the calculations of shots in time, so that new fleets can join the battle in the next round
- Pulsing Universe. At the very end of the round, all galaxies and systems merge into one huge system (unoccupied ss "collapse").
- Active pirates and aliens. From time to time from infinite distances come attacks on player planets.
- Space Storm. During the storm, energy production and everything related to the temperature of the planets is turned off or somehow modified.

## Carnage mode

After registration, instead of one main planet, players are drawn a fully packaged account (developed 9 planets with moons) and a decent fleet (20-40 Bn).

## Endgame mode

The modification limits the lifetime of the universe (xxx days).

The "Endgame" event is added to the event queue, which causes the effect after the specified number of days.

At the end, a page with the results is displayed (`index.php?page=endgame`) and the universe is paused until deleted (or a new round is started).
