**This is non commercial project, all Premium functions of original OGame (Dark Matter, Officeers and Trader) are free.**

All copyrighted material is proprietary Gameforge stuff. We do not make money on it! We just have fun =)

## Progress

The game is almost done. TODO list:
- Improve admin tool
- Improve bots AI
- Complete game localization (De, En)

## Credits

Credits go to Alexander RÃ¶sner (Legor) for such revolutionary breakthrough in browser games.
He was not first, but he was the one, who was successful.
To pay respect, we still have Legor's account, sitting on its own planet Arakis at [1:1:2] =)
