<b><u>Reasons for creating the project</u></b><br /><br />

A list of reasons why the Redesign is not suitable for normal play:
<ul>
<li>Pages weigh two or three times as much. Excessive load on traffic.</li>
<li>Page rendering is very slow due to the abundance of images, styles and overloaded javascript.</li>
<li>It's impossible to play smoothly from mobile devices.</li>
<li>Abundance of unfixable bugs. Constant appearance of new bugs.</li>
<li>Game balance changes (new planet activity in Overview (also buggy), Astrophysics, planet transfers, and more).</li>
</ul>

As a consequence, it is lost:
<ul>
<li>Ability to adequately manage fleets. Now to lift a fleet in 3-4 seconds or to simultaneously slow down 3-4 ACS attacks is an almost unrealistic task.</li>
<li>With the patched activity, a whole layer of the game is gone - the so-called "Ninja" attacks, where a player updates the Overview and suddenly catches an attacker with a Gate.</li>
<li>It takes 2-3 times longer than it used to take to save resources from all the planets or to save the deut on the moons</li>
<li>The chance of taking a fleet away in an emergency from a cell phone is reduced to zero.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />
<b><u>Differences to the original</u></b><br /><br />

Which is not going to happen in this project:
<ul>
<li>There will not be a Redesign and all of its features. The game will correspond to version 0.84</li>
<li>There will be no paid Dark Matter, however features for DM found on expeditions will be available (Officers and Merchant)</li>
</ul>

Fixed bugs of the original version 0.84: 
<ul>
<li>A buggy planet when attempting to colonize the 10th planet. It will be replaced by an Abandoned Colony.</li>
<li>Setting up an activity on the target planet, after returning your fleet to the source planet</li>
<li>Fleet cloning (lifting a fleet after an attack)</li>
<li>Negative resources (building order at the time of attack)</li>
<li>Slowing down the returning fleet recalled from the ACS Attack</li>
<li>Accelerating the return from an expedition</li>
<li>And others...</li>
</ul>
